# Redora

Hey guys, welcome to Redora, this is a trading prediction bot comprised of various types of Neural networks to make accurate predictions for 
your Financial timeseries. I initiated this project initially to predict Bitcoin Stocks, however due to the volitilty of cryptocurrency, i shall
just leave it to trading stocks. Be aware you may need to have a powerfull computer to run it ! also do not tamper too much with the sequence length and epoch i almost fried my processor but putting epoch at a high value as well as sequence length.

## Getting Started

Ok so youll need alooot of dependencies !!! i used many libraries in my program because due to the complexitity of enural networks i would not
have been able to complete such a ambicious project with straight hard coded functions. If you plan to further develop Redora you may need the following dependancies installed:

```
Matplotlib
Random
numpy
csv
lstm
time
tensorflow
sklearn.svm import SVR
pandas
sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaller
tkner
```
 

### Prerequisites

This project was coded in Python so you will need to know about the ins and outs of python prior to working on Redora,
not much just a fresher course to recap your programming skills.



### Running Redora

If you wish to run the whole program in a comiled version, go to the comiled file and run the file named:

```
graphing.py
```

This version is a development version of Redora so ull need to have python installed on your PC.
